This is a post to show how I employed "If, else if, else" syntax commands and operator. I applied my current programming skills from lecture to provide outputs whether a sweather is needed based on weather conditions like temperature and humidity. 

## My Attempt at the Sweater Weather Assignment

{: .box-note}
**Task:** Create C-program called "sweater' that will output a statement to describe the appropriate weather gear for that temperature. 


## Sweater Weather Outputs

![Code Output](https:jodiem55assets/img/sweater-weather-output-screenshot.png.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

 ## First Output: "Maybe a light cardigan?"
 
  This output comes from our else if statement that is toggled under the conditions that the temperature is **greater than or equal to** 58 degrees F *and* the humidity is greater than or equal to 68%.  

 ## Second Output: "Hey Siri, Play Sweater Weather by The Neighborhood." 

  This output came from our else statement that is toggled under the conditions that the temperature is **NOT** greater than 60 degrees, greater than or equal to 58 degrees F, nor is the humidity greater than or equal to 68%. I thought it would have been silly to miss the opportunity to reference [this angsty fall anthem.](https://open.spotify.com/track/2QjOHCTQ1Jl3zawyYOpxh6?si=7bf0391c07f54e2c)

  ## Tips 

  Don't forget to add semi-colons, brackets, and conditional statements when appropriate. For example, the else statment -which can only be employed once, must **never** have a conditional statement follow. Remembering syntax rules makes coding so much easier.
